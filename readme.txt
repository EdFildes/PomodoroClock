This pomodoro clock is meant as a study aid. 
You should be able to set both the study and break timer in increments of 5 minutes.
There should be the option of looping through study and break and back again.
Perhaps there is a radio switch that changes from study to break when going from one to another.
When the study timer ends, the break timer should then begin.

I'm choosing the react framework upon which to complete this.
This is because using state seems like quite an elegant solution and I also want some practise with react.
I can set state for both study and break times then pass these to two timer components, 
one of which will display while the other is hidden and vice versa. Obviously it will be 
the currently active timer which is visible.
